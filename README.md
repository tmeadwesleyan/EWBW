We have numerous goals in different spheres of this project. 

On a tangible, strictly client relating aspect, we want to be make deadlines well in advance, find useful results, and communicate our findings in the end in a clear, sophisticated way. 

On a more overarching note, as our first consulting project, we want to be able to contribute and work efficiently in a group, learn how to communicate with each other and with out client, take on responsibility and set each other up for success in the best way possible.
